# Sound

Sound is a medium (air), vibrating.

Us humans make a distinction between sound and noise:

When air is displaced in certain patterns our brains can recognize, we call it sound.
When air is displaced in patterns our brain _can't_ recognize, we call it noise.

### Speakers

To generate sound from an electronic device we need something we commonly call a speaker.

A speaker works by converting electronic current to movement to vibrate air.

This electronic current is an analog signal, which means that it also has a wave pattern unlike a digital signal, which is an off-or-on current, 0's and 1's.
